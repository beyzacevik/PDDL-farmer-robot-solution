# PDDL-farmer-robot-solution

This project includes a basic logic that every farmer robot should have.

  
FARMER ROBBY

This robot can identify the status of a field. And it can find the required tools on the field. It can harvest the new crops by grasping and using pruning shears and collect them. It can also grasp either seed package and spread a fixed amount of seed to the empty field and water seeds to grow.
